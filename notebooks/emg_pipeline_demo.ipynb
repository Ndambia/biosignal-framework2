     "# EMG Signal Processing Pipeline Demo\n",
     "\n",
     "This notebook demonstrates a complete Electromyography (EMG) signal processing pipeline. EMG signals measure the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles and are widely used in medical diagnostics, rehabilitation, and human-computer interaction.\n",
     "\n",
     "The pipeline includes:\n",
     "\n",
     "- Data loading and preprocessing (filtering, denoising, normalization)\n",
     "- Feature extraction (time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear features)\n",
     "- Model training and evaluation (using classical ML approaches)\n",
     "- Real-time processing demonstration\n",
     "\n",
     "## Setup\n",
     "\n",
     "First, we'll import the required modules. Our custom modules include:\n",
     "\n",
     "- `preprocessing`: Signal filtering and normalization tools\n",
     "- `features`: Feature extraction methods for biosignals\n",
     "- `models`: Machine learning model implementations\n",
     "- `acquisition`: Data acquisition and real-time processing\n",
     "- `utils`: Utility functions for visualization\n",
     "- `simulation`: Biosignal simulation capabilities"
